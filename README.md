# mini_library
A mini-library application that uses ISBN numbers to track books. So small it will fit on a Raspberry Pi.

This is very much a work in progress. Two things inspired it. First, I had a few Raspberry Pis laying around. 
Second, my wife, who is a teacher, spent a ton of time entering all of the books she bought for her classroom 
into an Excel spreadsheet to track them. Third, my daughter is interested in Robotics and technology and 
I thought this would make a good project for the two of us, as it requires both hardware and software modification..
